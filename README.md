<!-- ======================= SNAPSHOT ======================= -->

## About Me

I am a backend focused Software Engineer specializing in **distributed systems and production-grade services** that operate reliably under **scale, concurrency, and failure**. My work focuses on building **fault-tolerant execution platforms, data-intensive pipelines, and low latency backend services**, with an emphasis on **correctness, observability, and predictable system behavior** across **ETL pipelines, enterprise integrations, distributed schedulers, and event driven architectures**.

I approach AI and machine learning from an **engineering-first perspective**, treating models as software components that must be **deployed, monitored, validated, and safely evolved in production**. I am particularly interested in **ML inference systems, failure analysis, and system level validation**, and I prioritize **clear system design, disciplined trade-off reasoning, and ownership of production outcomes**.

<!-- ======================= CURRENT FOCUS ======================= -->

## Current Focus Areas

- **Distributed job scheduling & orchestration systems**  
- **Feature flag & dynamic configuration platforms** (low latency, HA)  
- **ML inference pipelines with monitoring, rollback & validation hooks**  
- **Failure analysis for multi-step AI reasoning & production workflows**
