## About Me

I am a Software Engineer focused on building scalable, fault-tolerant backend systems with strong foundations in data integrity, distributed execution, and correctness-first design.

My experience spans production ETL pipelines, ERP/CRM integration platforms, and distributed scheduling systems. I work on backend services that operate reliably under scale, concurrency, and failure, with an emphasis on observability, validation, and predictable system behavior.

## Currently Working On

- Distributed job scheduling platforms with fault-tolerant execution and persistent state management.
- Feature flag and configuration systems optimized for low-latency, high-availability environments.
- Formal validation and failure analysis workflows for multi-step AI reasoning systems.

## Experience

### Computer Science Fellow — Handshake AI  
San Francisco, CA | Sep 2025 – Nov 2025

- Devised a formal logic benchmarking suite targeting multi-step AI reasoning, creating 20+ structured validation workflows enforcing strict algorithmic correctness.
- Systematized a failure analysis protocol by tracing assumption breakdowns across 500+ inference samples, improving the model review lifecycle by ~15%.

---

### Data Engineering Intern — NielsenIQ  
Gujarat, India | Feb 2024 – Jul 2024

- Optimized production ETL pipelines supporting analytics and ML batch jobs by restructuring SQL aggregations and Python transformation layers, reducing end-to-end runtime by ~13%.
- Implemented automated data validation and consistency checks across multi-table datasets, blocking 99% of malformed records from downstream reporting and model inputs.

## Key Projects

### TaskFlow — Distributed Job Scheduling Platform  
*Java · Spring Boot · PostgreSQL · Redis · Docker*

- Constructed a fault-tolerant execution engine sustaining 5k+ queued jobs by implementing PostgreSQL-backed persistent state and exponential backoff strategies.
- Scaled stateless worker nodes to achieve 2× throughput using Redis-based distributed task leasing and atomic locking to prevent race conditions.

---

### FlagGate — Feature Flag & Configuration Platform  
*Java · Spring Boot · Apache Cassandra · Apache Kafka · Docker*

- Deployed a low-latency evaluation service delivering sub-20ms P99 latency using Cassandra’s tunable consistency and hot-path caching.
- Integrated an event-driven propagation system using Kafka, achieving 99.9% synchronization reliability during percentage-based configuration rollouts.
